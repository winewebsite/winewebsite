        <h4>Wine types&differentiation across UAS</h4>
        <p>According to a series of statistics for the U.S wine market of recent years, the wine market is at a growth
            period as a result of the shifting demographic trends within the United States.
            Euromonitor International (2017) indicates that the ageing population of the most loyal, target consumers of
            wine has resulted in an industry and market that caters to the socio-economic backgrounds.
            The significance of millenials and generation X in the wine market is apparent, as demand amongst the
            demographic rises, yet there is a need for high-quality and premium wines to be at an affordable price,
            which is apparent as their levels of consumption differs greatly from that of the older generations.</p>
        <p> Therefore, this website has been created for all wine users alike, from the casual drinker taking an
            interest to the connoiseurs and enthusiasts, to enable all generations to be aware of high-quality wines
            at affordable prices.</p>
        <p>This study was limited to the perceptions of a range of master sommeliers collected from WineEnthusiast
            (2018) website as to the reviews and descriptions of the high-quality wines of the U.S that are evaluated
            based
            on the price and points assigned to them. For the purpose of the study, the high-quality or top wines are
            defined as the wines that has points over 80 out of 100.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the study was to offer information about the distribution of the high-quality wines produced
            in the United States. This website looks to offer the user a useful tool in identifying the cost, the
            quality and the value of those top wines like a master sommelier though blind tasting. </p>
        <p>The aim of this project is realised by an interactive map website developed by our group within Spatial Data
            Capture coursework. It is not only spatial visualisation but also general information about the wines by
            state including their variety, winery, designation, region etc.</p>
        <p>The report also includes incisive graphics and information for wine related industry.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This project intends to aid the casual wine drinker and the enthusiasts alike through providing a map of the
            all the markers you may want to know about wine. Using the interactive map, the user can look at a location
            and quickly identify common flavours, quality, price and value for money that they can expect.</p>
