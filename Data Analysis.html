        <h3>The Data Analysis Behind The Website</h3>

<div class='Data Analysis' style='font-size:14px'>
    <p></p>
    <i style="text-align:center;">
    <p> The idea of this project was to use our dataset to produce a website that creates an
        easy interactive way for a user to find out facts about a certain state's wine production.
        This included Price, Score (Quality), Value for Money and common flavours. However, it was
        also intended that it would be educational about environmental factors that could potentially
        improve the quality of wine being output by a state. Therefore the analysis was broken down
        into the following sections. </p>
    <br>
    <h4> Price and Score </h4>
    <br>
    <p> Price and Score are two key variables in this data analysis. A functional part of this
        website is to show prices and scores of certain areas which was achieved through the mapping
        of the data. Therefore users are able to see which states score the best or which state is
        the priciest/cheapest. </p>
    <br>
    <h5> Value for Money </h5>
    <p> Value for money is a concept that was created for the specific use of this website. It's
        purpose is too show how good the quality of the wine is for the price paid. It would do this by
        identifying the difference in a wine scoring 90 points for the price of $30 compared to a wine of
        the same quality for a higher or lower price. To do this an index was created from the combined
        values of price and score.</p>

    <br>
    <h6>Common Flavours</h6>
    <p> An integral part of our analysis was to produce a map of flavours. It was a key aim to be
        able to show the user where in the US they can expect certain flavours. Using python, it was
        possible to chop up the review data and count the most commonly reoccurring flavours that reviewers
        were experiencing whilst tasting the wine. Based on this, the flavours occurring the most can
        be mapped into a flavour profile for the US. The flavour profile of the US can be seen below in the map</p>

    } </script>
    <p> Yellow states show data pertaining to the flavour profile of that state</p>
    <p> Grey States had no available data</p>
    <br>
    <h7>Climate and Quality</h7>
    <br>
    <p> The purpose of the website was also to explore some defining factors in the quality of the wine.
        Therefore, sunshine exposure (as a percentage), humidity (as a percentage) and rainfall (by inch)
        were tested through regression to see if a favourable climate produced some flavourable wine. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Highlights of the analysis</h3>
    <p>According to a series of statistics for the U.S wine market of recent years, the wine market is at a growth
        period as a result of the trends of demographic shift of the United States.
        Euromonitor International (2017) indicates that the ageing of the most loyal and target consumers of wine
        results in the differences for the wine industry and market.
        The significance of millennials and generation X is flourishing and the demand for high-quality and premium
        wines at an affordable price level is highlighted as their consumption concepts are different with older
        generations. </p>
    <p>This study was limited to the perceptions of a range of master sommeliers collected from WineEnthusiast
        (2018)
        website as to the reviews and descriptions of the high-quality wines of the U.S that are evaluated based
        on the price and points assigned to them. For the purpose of the study, the high-quality or top wines are
        defined as the wines that has points over 80 out of 100.</p>

    <h3>Major findings</h3>
    <p>We can see that the states of Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington break past the 92-point mark when it comes
        to
        value for money, placing in the top three for the average value for money.
        Rhode Island comes out on top with the highest average quality wines with low average costs. Washington and
        Oregon, place 2nd and 3rd, producing high quality wines, yet with higher costing wine.
        New York manages to also break the 92-point mark, but with lower quality wine and much cheaper prices.
        Whilst California is also producing good value for money wines, albeit slightly lower than the previously
        mentioned wines, the customer would be expected to pay the highest costs for a less superior product.
        Nevada and Kentucky are the two lowest ranking states in terms of value for money. Their wines are two of
        the
        costliest, falling below only California in terms of costs, and yet Nevada and Kentucky scored on average
        84.25
        and 83 on quality. Whilst these aren’t the lowest scores, States producing similar or worse quality wine,
        such
        as Iowa and Missouri, having significantly lower costs which in turn aid in bringing their value for money
        up
        in the rankings. In all the graph works well in telling the user where they might have to pay more for
        inferior
        products, or what they might have to compromise on to get a little more for their money. For instance, a
        user of this will now know that they could get a similar higher quality wine in Washington for a cheaper
        cost
        than in California. Alternatively, a user will know that in Iowa or Ohio, they won’t necessarily get great
        quality wine, but their money will go further.</p>

    <p>By far the most developed states when it comes to wines are located on the west of USA. California,
        Washington
        and Oregon states produce the biggest amount of top-quality wines.
        Similarly, we can observe that top scoring wineries are also located within those states (plus Rhode
        Island). On
        the East Coast the biggest producer is New York (by number of produced wines).
        However, by looking at the list of the scores of the best value for money single wines it does not only come
        to
        those 3 states but is divided fairly equally across the United States.</p>

                                                                                     href="Top 10 Value for money Wines.csv">Top

    <p>
    <p> The Value for Money Index was created for the purposes of letting the users know which wine would give the
        user
        the most for their money. Therefore the top 5 wines, where applicable, were listed and ranked by the index
        created for this project. Therefore any wine enthusiast can scroll through this handy table and immediately
        be
        informed of on whether or not they will be paying a fair price for the quality of wine in a chosen state.
