                <p>The purpose of the study was to offer information of the distribution of the high-quality wines
                    produced in
                    the United States and identify the value of those top wines like a master sommelier though blind

                <p>The aim of this project is realised by an interactive map website developed by our group within
                    Spatial Data
                    Capture coursework. It is not only spatial visualisation but also general information about the
                    wines by
                    state including their variety, winery, designation, region etc.</p>
                <p>The report also includes incisive graphics and information for wine related industry.</p>
                <p></p>

    <h2><b>DATA HIGHLIGHTS</b></h2>
    <br>
    <div id="text">

        <p></p>
        <p> The idea of this project was to use our dataset to produce a website that creates an
            easy interactive way for a user to find out facts about a certain state's wine production.
            This included Price, Score (Quality), Value for Money and common flavours. However, it was
            also intended that it would be educational about environmental factors that could potentially
            improve the quality of wine being output by a state. Therefore the analysis was broken down
            into the following sections. </p>
        <h3> Price and Score </h3>
        <p></p>
        <p> Price and Score are two key variables in this data analysis. A functional part of this
            website is to show prices and scores of certain areas which was achieved through the mapping
            of the data. Therefore users are able to see which states score the best or which state is
            the priciest/cheapest. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3> Value for Money </h3>
        <p></p>
        <p> Value for money is a concept that was created for the specific use of this website. It's
            purpose is too show how good the quality of the wine is for the price paid. It would do this by
            identifying the difference in a wine scoring 90 points for the price of $30 compared to a wine of
            the same quality for a higher or lower price. To do this an index was created from the combined
            values of price and score.</p>
        <p>Here you can find full table with Value for money scores for each state</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Common Flavours</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p> An integral part of our analysis was to produce a map of flavours. It was a key aim to be
            able to show the user where in the US they can expect certain flavours. Using python, it was
            possible to chop up the review data and count the most commonly reoccurring flavours that reviewers
            were experiencing whilst tasting the wine. Based on this, the flavours occurring the most can
            be mapped into a flavour profile for the US. The flavour profile of the US can be seen below in the map</p>
        <p> Yellow states show data pertaining to the flavour profile of that state</p>
        <p> Grey States had no available data</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Climate and Quality</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p> The purpose of the website was also to explore some defining factors in the quality of the wine.
            Therefore, sunshine exposure (as a percentage), humidity (as a percentage) and rainfall (by inch)
            were tested through regression to see if a favourable climate produced some flavourable wine. </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Highlights of the analysis</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>According to a series of statistics for the U.S wine market of recent years, the wine market is at a growth
            period as a result of the trends of demographic shift of the United States.
            Euromonitor International (2017) indicates that the ageing of the most loyal and target consumers of wine
            results in the differences for the wine industry and market.
            The significance of millennials and generation X is flourishing and the demand for high-quality and premium
            wines at an affordable price level is highlighted as their consumption concepts are different with older
            generations. </p>
        <p>This study was limited to the perceptions of a range of master sommeliers collected from WineEnthusiast
            (2018)
            website as to the reviews and descriptions of the high-quality wines of the U.S that are evaluated based
            on the price and points assigned to them. For the purpose of the study, the high-quality or top wines are
            defined as the wines that has points over 80 out of 100.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Major findings</h3>
        <p></p>
        <div id ="container2" style="height: 50vh;width: 70vw;margin-right: 15vw"></div>
        <p></p>
        <p>We can see that the states of Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington break past the 92-point mark when it comes
            to
            value for money, placing in the top three for the average value for money.
            Rhode Island comes out on top with the highest average quality wines with low average costs. Washington and
            Oregon, place 2nd and 3rd, producing high quality wines, yet with higher costing wine.
            New York manages to also break the 92-point mark, but with lower quality wine and much cheaper prices.
            Whilst California is also producing good value for money wines, albeit slightly lower than the previously
            mentioned wines, the customer would be expected to pay the highest costs for a less superior product.
            Nevada and Kentucky are the two lowest ranking states in terms of value for money. Their wines are two of
            the
            costliest, falling below only California in terms of costs, and yet Nevada and Kentucky scored on average
            84.25
            and 83 on quality. Whilst these aren’t the lowest scores, States producing similar or worse quality wine,
            such
            as Iowa and Missouri, having significantly lower costs which in turn aid in bringing their value for money
            up
            in the rankings. In all the graph works well in telling the user where they might have to pay more for
            inferior
            products, or what they might have to compromise on to get a little more for their money. For instance, a
            user of this will now know that they could get a similar higher quality wine in Washington for a cheaper
            cost
            than in California. Alternatively, a user will know that in Iowa or Ohio, they won’t necessarily get great
            quality wine, but their money will go further.</p>
        <br>

        <!--<img class='chart2' src="chart2.jpg" alt="Average Score, Price and Value for Money Chart">-->
        <div id ="container1" style="height: 50vh;width: 70vw;margin-right: 15vw"></div>
        <p></p>
        <p>By far the most developed states when it comes to wines are located on the west of USA. California,
            Washington
            and Oregon states produce the biggest amount of top-quality wines.
            Similarly, we can observe that top scoring wineries are also located within those states (plus Rhode
            Island). On
            the East Coast the biggest producer is New York (by number of produced wines).
            However, by looking at the list of the scores of the best value for money single wines it does not only come
            to
            those 3 states but is divided fairly equally across the United States.</p>
        <p>Here you can find full table with Value for money scores for each state</p><a target="_blank"
                                                                                         href="Top 10 Value for money Wines.csv">Top
        10 Value for money Wines</a>
        <p>
        <p> The Value for Money Index was created for the purposes of letting the users know which wine would give the
            user
            the most for their money. Therefore the top 5 wines, where applicable, were listed and ranked by the index
            created for this project. Therefore any wine enthusiast can scroll through this handy table and immediately
            be
            informed of on whether or not they will be paying a fair price for the quality of wine in a chosen state.
